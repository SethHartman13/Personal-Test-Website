    <button class="accordion active">For Windows Users:</button>
    <div class="panel" style="display: block;">
        <ol>
            <li>Before downloading, check to make sure you don't already have Git installed on your computer</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on the 'Start' window icon on your computer in the bottom left of your screen.</li>
                <li>Type 'cmd' to open the Command Prompt app. You should get the Command Prompt terminal to open. It
                    doesn't matter what your prompt path is.</li>
                <li>Type in
                    <pre>git --version</pre> and hit enter.
                </li>
                <p>You should now either see a git version number come up or a message that says something about how
                    'git' is not recognized. If you have a version number come up, you already have git installed and
                    you don't need to install it. If you get the message that git is not recognized then you need to
                    install it.</p>
            </ul>
            <li>To install Git for Windows. Go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads"
                    target="_blank">git-scm.com/downloads</a> and click on 'Windows' under Downloads. An .exe file
                should be downloaded.</li>
            <li>Click that .exe file to open it and it will begin the process of installing Git.</li>
            <li>Allow it to make changes to your device.</li>
            <li>Click 'Next' through all of the setup windows leaving all the defaults as they are. There will be quite
                a few windows.</li>
            <li>The last window will let you click 'Install' and click 'Finish'.</li>
            <li>Open up a new Command Prompt window by closing the first Command Prompt window and start a new one by
                typing 'cmd' at the Windows start button in the bottom left of your screen again. At the prompt, type:
                <pre>git --version</pre> again if you want to see that it installed. You should now see the version
                number. (If you don't use a new Command Prompt window, you could get the same message you had before you
                installed Git.)
            </li>
            <p>While we are still in the Command Prompt we will type in two more commands to set up our username and
                email that are associated with our GitHub account. Again it doesn't matter what the path prompt is.
                These are global settings so you can type them from any path prompt.</p>
            <li>The command is listed below, but make sure you use your own username and email between the "" quotes.
                Use the username and your email you used for the GitHub account. It will be different for everyone.
                Type:
                <pre>git config --global user.name "<em>yourusername</em>"</pre>
                and then hit enter. Nothing will happen if you did it right.
                And then type:
                <pre>git config --global user.email "<em>youremail@byui.edu</em>"</pre>
                and then hit enter again.
            </li>
            <p>Now you have configured your Git to recognize your GitHub later.</p>
        </ol>
